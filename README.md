# LoLStats

Welcome to LoLStats, an interactive web application dedicated to helping League of Legends players track and analyze their in-game performance. LoLStats utilizes the Riot API to provide a comprehensive collection of detailed match statistics and player data.

**Note: I tried to make the app responsive but haven't really figured it out for mobile devices yet, so the web app is optimized for desktop/laptop screens. Also if you want to try the app but don't know what player to search up, you can look up my username, "Prat#GPT".**
